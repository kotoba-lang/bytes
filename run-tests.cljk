;; nbb entry -- the SAME .cljc suites the JVM runs. This library's README says
;; the code is identical on JVM and ClojureScript; until this existed, only the
;; JVM half was ever checked.

;; nbb prints its own summary; this supplies the exit code, because a suite
;; that fails while exiting 0 is worse than one that does not run.
